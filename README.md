# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have SDL installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open the project in CLion 2024.1.1 or any other C++ IDE that supports CMake.
4. Build and run the project.

## Features

- Grid-based path-finding simulation.
- Interactive mode to add or remove walls.
- Visual representation of the path to the target.

## How to play

- Use ESC to switch between edit and simulation mode.
- When in edit mode, left-click to add a cell or right-click to remove a wall.
- When in simulation mode, the agent will automatically find the shortest path to the target.

## Limitations

- The project currently uses absolute paths for asset loading, which might need to be adjusted on your system.
- The path-finding algorithm is simple and does not handle complex scenarios.

## Future Work

- Implement a more advanced path-finding algorithm like A*.
- Add support for multiple agents and targets.
- Improve the user interface and controls.
